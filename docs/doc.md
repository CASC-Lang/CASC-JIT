# CASC Documention (EN)  

## Introduction  

CASC is a handwritten compiler which have syntaxes for both Englsih and Manderin. It is:  

* Strong typing
* Highly customizable syntax typing (Mixed Manderin and English code is valid)

CASC is basically an improved JavaScript with statically typing.

This documention will take you around CASC programming language's features, once you finish the documention, you mostly learned the entire CASC programming language's features.

## Installation

Currently we don't provide user a easy installation process, but you can still get it from CASC GitHub repository's Releases. Once you downloaded it from Releases, there'll be a file called CASC-Compiler.exe inside the zip file.

Though CASC do have a repl for users to test out syntaxes, but the output of the repl is pretty much a disaster for now, if you are encountering n output issue, type /clear to clear the entire console.
